# Virus Slasher VR using WebXR
An evaluation of WebXR

## Info

Shoot down huge coronaviruses projected at you. This project uses WebXR to evaluate its capabilities and performance on VR devices

## Outcome

Tested on Oculus Quest. The performance wasn't satisfactory. It struggled to achieve 90 fps despite several optimization measures. Please note that this was my first try with WebXR and so it doesn't indicate the best results you can achieve with WebXR.

It is usable, but I'll recommend sticking with native VR SDKs to emjoy rich capabilities of VR.
